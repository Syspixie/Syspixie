Now retired, I spent most of my career playing with computers - initially as a VAX system manager and programmer
(FORTRAN, C, MACRO-32 assember), then a Windows programmer (Visual Basic, C#), and a SQL Server database
administrator.

Retirement has allowed me to go right back to my electronics engineering background: designing and building circuits
for model railways, and writing microcontroller firmware code.  The model railway itself - well, I'll get around to
building that, eventually...

I live in Dorset, England.
